# tafkars-lemmy

Tafkars stands for "The API formerly known as...", is written in Rust and is pronounced like "tough cars".  
`tafkars-lemmy` is an API proxy that allows apps to talk to [Lemmy](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy) through a familiar API from a kinder time.  
The hope is that this will make it easy for app developers to support Lemmy with only minimal code changes.
