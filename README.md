# Tafkars

Tafkars stands for "The API formerly known as...", is written in Rust and is pronounced like "tough cars".

- [`tafkars`](tafkars) contains API bindings for that one site that people used to love.
- [`tafkars-lemmy`](tafkars-lemmy) is an API proxy that allows apps to talk to [Lemmy](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy) through a familiar API from a kinder time.

## Help wanted

There is still lots of work to be done, especially on [`tafkars-lemmy`](tafkars-lemmy). Pull requests welcome!
